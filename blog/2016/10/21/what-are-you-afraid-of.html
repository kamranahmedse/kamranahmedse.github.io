    <p>Being developers, we have all been at the point where we have done several side projects; sometimes just to try that interesting technology that is being buzzed around and the others when we start something with the hopes of taking the world on. First type of projects are good as they usually serve their purpose but the problem with latter ones is that most of the times although you start with an excitement, eventually you end up having second thoughts and come up with the reasons to shelve them; thus not getting anything out of them except the loss of time. These excuses mostly start with, <em>it won't work because (some excuse)</em></p>
<p><em>..there is something similar in the market</em></p>
<p><em>..I have a full time job</em></p>
<p><em>..I don't have enough money</em></p>
<p><em>..no body is going to invest</em></p>
<p><em>..it ain't worth the risk</em></p>
<p>Almost all of us have questions like this when we think of accomplishing something new. And it is usually the questions like this which hinder our way to the success. In my own experience, I have come to terms with the fact that it all depends upon how you react; whether you take the excuses like these as challenges to be tackled or as the reasons for why you will fail.</p>

<p>I have been reading this amazing book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Magic-Thinking-David-Schwartz/dp/0671646788">The Magic of Thinking Big</a> by David J. Schwartz and I must say that it is one of my favorite reads so far. Here is a chunk from it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Think success, don’t think failure. At work, in your home, substitute success thinking for failure thinking. When you face a difficult situation, think, ‘I’ll win,’ not ‘I’ll probably lose.’ When you compete with someone else, think, ‘I’m equal to the best,’ not ‘I’m outclassed.’ When opportunity appears, think, ‘I can do it,’ never ‘I can’t.’ Let the master thought ‘I will succeed’ dominate your thinking process.</p>
  <p>Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite.</p>
  <p>Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts that produce failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some may argue for me being the best employee (pun intended ;)), I have never been a good employer when it comes to personal projects. I have done so many side projects and put them on the shelf, staying in the comfort zone, not doing what may fail. It is time to change that. I have already been working towards completing the MVP. I haven’t got a clue to what it is going to be and I couldn't be more excited.</p>
<p>And that about wraps it up. What are you afraid of? What is it that is holding you back? What is your excuse to not start? Follow up with the comments section below.</p>
